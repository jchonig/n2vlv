            <p>
              When I was in Junior High School we visited a family friend
              who was an amateur radio operator.  I was intrigued by
              his ham shack.  He ended up giving me a Hallicrafters
              short wave receiver.
            </p>

            <p>
              Back at school I would carry around the
              <a href="https://www.arrl.org" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">ARRL</a> Handbook; back then it was on
              paper and the size of a major city phone book (if you
              are too young to know what that is, google it). In High
              School I joined the local Civil Defense with the idea of
              taking classes to study for my amateur radio
              license. However, the folks that ran Civil Defense were
              not ready to deal with exuberant teenagers and nothing
              came of it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then I got distracted by CB radio and communicated with
              friends that way until I went to college. At one point I
              tried mounting a 6' whip to my bicycle and powering a
              mobile CB with a battery pack. But there wasn't enough
              power in the NiCad packs of the day and it did not
              really work.
            </p>

	    <p>
	      When I went to college I forgot about Ham Radio in
	      general.  After college, when I was working at the
	      Clarkson University Computing Center I initiated a
	      project to get business-band radios for the techs to
	      carry around to stay in contact.
	    </p>

            <p>
              Now that I'm retired I figured I can spend the time to
              study for my license. I asked a neighbor friend who
              happens to be the president of
              the <a href="https://tcara-ny.org" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">Tompkins County Amateur Radio
              Association</a> for recommendations to study for the
              exam. He recommended finding online tests and keep
              taking them until I pass. I eventually ended up on
              <a href="https://hamstudy.org" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">hamstudy.org</a> and their Android app
              and took a couple dozen Technician exams and several
              dozen General exams. Several weeks later I took the
              exams on August 2, 2025; I aced the Technician exam and
              passed the General exam with 30 of 35 correct. I was
              initially assigned a call sign
              of <strong>KE2GMJ</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              On August 23, 2025 my vanity call sign came through. I'm
              now <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/N2VLV"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"><strong>N2VLV</strong></a> (as in VoLVo).
            </p>

            <p>
              While taking the Technician and General practice exams, I took
              a practice exam for Amateur Extra and did horribly. Over the
              next six weeks I kept studying and started passing, achieving
              as high as 48 on two practice exams. On September 20, 2025 I
              sat for the Amateur Extra exam and passed with 46 of 50
              correct!
            </p>

            <p>
              I submitted my open book exam to be
              an <a href="https://www.arrl.org" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">ARRL</a> accredited
              <a href="https://www.arrl.org" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">Volunteer Examiner</a>. Instead of taking
              3–4 weeks, my paperwork arrived exactly a week later.
