  Description: |
    ## My First Radio
    Well, technically my first radio was a QuanSheng UV-K6 (aka QuanSheng UV-K5(8)) which is a $30 UHF/VHF HT.  But that's another story.

    While looking at radios I was intrigued by the Vero/VGC VR-N76 HT
    which has a plethora of digital capabilities and can be fully app
    controlled.  Then I learned about the VR-N7500 which is a headless
    50W mobile with full control from an Android App via Bluetooth.
    There were some pointers to the BHM-78 which looks like a HT, but
    is just a Bluetooth remote for the radio.  But they don't make
    them anymore.

    Then I found someone near Buffallo on Facebook Marketplace that
    had both a BHM-78 and an N7500 for sale.  Unfortunately for my
    patience, shipping was much cheaper than a 480 mile drive.

    I plugged the radio into a 12V power supply and connected the HT
    app and the first thing it did was ask if I wanted to update the
    Firmware.  Of course I did.

    Then I paired the BHM-78 and started playing around.

    ## Audio

    There are many ways to send and receive on the radio

    The optional wired handset
      + An external speaker (receive only)
      + Via the HT app through the phone (and then out to other BT devices)
      + Via the BHM-78 handset
      + Directly connected BT headsets

    THe VGC handsets have PTT buttons. Via the phone you need to hold a button on the phone.  There is a Bluetooth PTT switch that you can wear like a ring.

    The BHM-78 will also connect to a phone for audio.

    ## SSTV

    KD2EAT recommended I try receiving an SSTV signal in preparation
    for receiving a balloon launch on August 13.  I spent a lot of
    time searching the web to figure out how to do it.  Do I need to
    install Robot36?  Another App?  Then I read something that said
    the HT app will just decode the signal if you go into the Messages
    tab.  So KD2EAT keyed up his base and sent a picture.

    At first we were talking on the phone via the car Speakerphone and
    the HT app was picking up the audio which distorted the signal.

    It's also necessary to turn off APRS while receiving SSTV as it
    can interfere with the decoding of the image.

    ## App Control
    
    The HT app works fine from my Pixel 9 Pro.  I tried running the
    Android App on an x86 and ARM ChromeBook, but it was unable to
    connect to the radio.  I guess I need an Android Tablet in the
    vehicle for dedicated control of the radio....

    ## Installation

    I purchased a used Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+) and a
    DCHouse 12V 100AH LiFePo4 trolling motor battery to avoid putting
    a strain on my car battery.  The battery can charge via a LiOn
    charger, via a DC port, or via USB-C (at 60W).

    I tested this installation by listening in on a few TCARA Sunday
    Night Nets and having a conversation with Mike (KD2EAT) over the
    hill into Trumansburg.  This was primarily using Bluetooth to the
    car Speakerphone.

- Title: My Journey to a Ham Radio License
  Background: N2VLV_Extra.png
  Description: |
    When I was in Junior High School we visited a family friend
    who was an amateur radio operator.  I was intrigued by
    his ham shack.  He ended up giving me a Hallicrafters
    short wave receiver.

    Back at school I would carry around the
    [AARL](https://www.arrl.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} [Handbook](https://www.arrl.org/arrl-handbook-2023){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; back then
    it was on paper and the size of a major city phone book (if you
    are too young to know what that is, Google it). In High School I
    joined the local Civil Defense with the idea of taking classes to
    study for my amateur radio license. However, the folks that ran
    Civil Defense were not ready to deal with exuberant teenagers and
    nothing came of it.

    Then I got distracted by CB radio and communicated with
    friends that way until I went to college. At one point I
    tried mounting a 6' whip to my bicycle and powering a
    mobile CB with a battery pack. But there wasn't enough
    power in the NiCad packs of the day and it did not
    really work.

    When I went to college I forgot about Ham Radio in
    general.  After college, when I was working at the
    Clarkson University Computing Center I initiated a
    project to get business-band radios for the techs to
    carry around to stay in contact.

    Now that I'm retired I figured I can spend the time to study for
    my license. I asked a neighbor friend who happens to be the
    president of the [Tompkins County Amateur Radio
    Association](https://tcara-ny.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for recommendations to study
    for the exam. He recommended finding online tests and keep taking
    them until I pass. I eventually ended up on
    [hamstudy.org](https://hamstudy.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and their Android app and
    took a couple dozen Technician exams and several dozen General
    exams. Several weeks later I took the exams on August 2, 2025; I
    aced the Technician exam and passed the General exam with 30 of 35
    correct. I was initially assigned a call sign of
    <strong>KE2GMJ</strong>.

    On August 23, 2025 my vanity call sign came through. I'm
    now [N2VLV](https://www.qrz.com/db/N2VLV){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (as in VoLVo).

    While taking the Technician and General practice exams, I took
    a practice exam for Amateur Extra and did horribly. Over the
    next six weeks I kept studying and started passing, achieving
    as high as 48 on two practice exams. On September 20, 2025 I
    sat for the Amateur Extra exam and passed with 46 of 50
    correct!

    I submitted my open book exam to be
    an ARRL accredited
    [Volunteer Examiner](https://www.arrl.org/volunteer-examiners){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
    Instead of taking
    3–4 weeks, my paperwork arrived exactly a week later.
