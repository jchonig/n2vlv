- Title: My Journey to a Ham Radio License
  Background: N2VLV_Extra.png
  Description: |
    When I was in Junior High School we visited a family friend
    who was an amateur radio operator.  I was intrigued by
    his ham shack.  He ended up giving me a Hallicrafters
    short wave receiver.

    Back at school I would carry around the
    [AARL](https://www.arrl.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} [Handbook](https://www.arrl.org/arrl-handbook-2023){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}; back then
    it was on paper and the size of a major city phone book (if you
    are too young to know what that is, Google it). In High School I
    joined the local Civil Defense with the idea of taking classes to
    study for my amateur radio license. However, the folks that ran
    Civil Defense were not ready to deal with exuberant teenagers and
    nothing came of it.

    Then I got distracted by CB radio and communicated with
    friends that way until I went to college. At one point I
    tried mounting a 6' whip to my bicycle and powering a
    mobile CB with a battery pack. But there wasn't enough
    power in the NiCad packs of the day and it did not
    really work.

    When I went to college I forgot about Ham Radio in
    general.  After college, when I was working at the
    Clarkson University Computing Center I initiated a
    project to get business-band radios for the techs to
    carry around to stay in contact.

    Now that I'm retired I figured I can spend the time to study for
    my license. I asked a neighbor friend who happens to be the
    president of the [Tompkins County Amateur Radio
    Association](https://tcara-ny.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for recommendations to study
    for the exam. He recommended finding online tests and keep taking
    them until I pass. I eventually ended up on
    [hamstudy.org](https://hamstudy.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and their Android app and
    took a couple dozen Technician exams and several dozen General
    exams. Several weeks later I took the exams on August 2, 2025; I
    aced the Technician exam and passed the General exam with 30 of 35
    correct. I was initially assigned a call sign of
    <strong>KE2GMJ</strong>.

    On August 23, 2025 my vanity call sign came through. I'm
    now [N2VLV](https://www.qrz.com/db/N2VLV){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (as in VoLVo).

    While taking the Technician and General practice exams, I took
    a practice exam for Amateur Extra and did horribly. Over the
    next six weeks I kept studying and started passing, achieving
    as high as 48 on two practice exams. On September 20, 2025 I
    sat for the Amateur Extra exam and passed with 46 of 50
    correct!

    I submitted my open book exam to be
    an ARRL accredited
    [Volunteer Examiner](https://www.arrl.org/volunteer-examiners){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
    Instead of taking
    3–4 weeks, my paperwork arrived exactly a week later.
