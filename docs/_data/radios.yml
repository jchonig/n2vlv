    ## My First Radio
    Well, technically my first radio was a QuanSheng UV-K6 (aka QuanSheng UV-K5(8)) which is a $30 UHF/VHF HT.  But that's another story.

    While looking at radios I was intrigued by the Vero/VGC VR-N76 HT
    which has a plethora of digital capabilities and can be fully app
    controlled.  Then I learned about the VR-N7500 which is a headless
    50W mobile with full control from an Android App via Bluetooth.
    There were some pointers to the BHM-78 which looks like a HT, but
    is just a Bluetooth remote for the radio.  But they don't make
    them anymore.

    Then I found someone near Buffallo on Facebook Marketplace that
    had both a BHM-78 and an N7500 for sale.  Unfortunately for my
    patience, shipping was much cheaper than a 480 mile drive.

    I plugged the radio into a 12V power supply and connected the HT
    app and the first thing it did was ask if I wanted to update the
    Firmware.  Of course I did.

    Then I paired the BHM-78 and started playing around.

    ## Audio

    There are many ways to send and receive on the radio

    The optional wired handset
      + An external speaker (receive only)
      + Via the HT app through the phone (and then out to other BT devices)
      + Via the BHM-78 handset
      + Directly connected BT headsets

    THe VGC handsets have PTT buttons. Via the phone you need to hold a button on the phone.  There is a Bluetooth PTT switch that you can wear like a ring.

    The BHM-78 will also connect to a phone for audio.

    ## SSTV

    KD2EAT recommended I try receiving an SSTV signal in preparation
    for receiving a balloon launch on August 13.  I spent a lot of
    time searching the web to figure out how to do it.  Do I need to
    install Robot36?  Another App?  Then I read something that said
    the HT app will just decode the signal if you go into the Messages
    tab.  So KD2EAT keyed up his base and sent a picture.

    At first we were talking on the phone via the car Speakerphone and
    the HT app was picking up the audio which distorted the signal.

    It's also necessary to turn off APRS while receiving SSTV as it
    can interfere with the decoding of the image.

    ## App Control

    The HT app works fine from my Pixel 9 Pro.  I tried running the
    Android App on an x86 and ARM ChromeBook, but it was unable to
    connect to the radio.  I guess I need an Android Tablet in the
    vehicle for dedicated control of the radio....

    ## Installation

    I purchased a used Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+) and a
    DCHouse 12V 100AH LiFePo4 trolling motor battery to avoid putting
    a strain on my car battery.  The battery can charge via a LiOn
    charger, via a DC port, or via USB-C (at 60W).

    I tested this installation by listening in on a few TCARA Sunday
    Night Nets and having a conversation with Mike (KD2EAT) over the
    hill into Trumansburg.  This was primarily using Bluetooth to the
    car Speakerphone.
